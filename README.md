# KHInsiderWebscraper

This Python script scrapes downloads.khinsider.com for mp3 files. Give it the url of a list of files you'd like (eg "http://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/pokemon-ruby-sapphire-music-super-complete") and it will fetch all of the files from that page and download them. 

This script is provided as-is and I won't be providing any support for it. Use it however you please, but I doubt it's useful for much other than what I designed it to do.
